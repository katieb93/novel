## Testing

The Novely project includes tests to ensure the functionality of key components, particularly those interacting with Supabase and the search features.

### ManuscriptSearch Component Tests

The ManuscriptSearch component has been tested to ensure that it renders correctly and interacts properly with mock data:

javascript

Copy code

`import React from 'react';
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
import ManuscriptSearch from '../manuscriptSearch/manuscriptSearch';
import { supabase } from '../supabaseClient';

// Mock Supabase client to avoid testing actual Supabase functionality
jest.mock('../supabaseClient', () => ({
  supabase: {
    auth: {
      getUser: jest.fn(),
    },
    from: jest.fn(),
  },
}));

describe('ManuscriptSearch Component', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('renders the ManuscriptSearch component correctly without Supabase interactions', async () => {
    // Mock Supabase responses with dummy data
    supabase.auth.getUser.mockResolvedValue({
      data: {
        user: {
          id: '123',
          email: 'test@example.com',
        },
      },
    });

    supabase.from.mockImplementation((table) => {
      switch (table) {
        case 'genre_data':
          return {
            select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
              data: [
                { broad_genre: 'Fiction', subGenres: [] },
                { broad_genre: 'Non-Fiction', subGenres: [] },
              ],
              error: null,
            }),
          };
        case 'projects_author':
          return {
            select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
              data: [
                {
                  id: 1,
                  user_id: '123',
                  title: 'Test Project',
                  broad_genre: 'Fiction',
                  category: 'Novel',
                  genre: 'Drama',
                },
              ],
              error: null,
            }),
          };
        default:
          return { select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: [], error: null }) };
      }
    });

    render(<ManuscriptSearch />);

    expect(screen.getByText('Loading...')).toBeInTheDocument();

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Search')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });

  it('displays user data correctly after mock fetching', async () => {
    // Mock Supabase responses with dummy data
    supabase.auth.getUser.mockResolvedValue({
      data: {
        user: {
          id: '123',
          email: 'test@example.com',
        },
      },
    });

    supabase.from.mockImplementation((table) => {
      switch (table) {
        case 'genre_data':
          return {
            select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
              data: [
                { broad_genre: 'Fiction', subGenres: [] },
                { broad_genre: 'Non-Fiction', subGenres: [] },
              ],
              error: null,
            }),
          };
        case 'projects_author':
          return {
            select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
              data: [],
              error: null,
            }),
          };
        default:
          return { select: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({ data: [], error: null }) };
      }
    });

    render(<ManuscriptSearch />);

    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Search')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });

    expect(supabase.auth.getUser).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(screen.getByText('Search')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});` 

### Example: Publishing Dashboard

The `PubDashboard.js` component allows publishing professionals to manage their interactions with manuscripts. Here's an overview:

javascript

Copy code

`import React from 'react';
import PubDashboard from './publishing/PubDashboard';

const PublishingPage = () => (
  <div>
    <PubDashboard />
  </div>
);

export default PublishingPage;` 

### Example: Adding a Search

The `AddSearch.js` component allows publishing professionals to define search criteria for manuscripts:

javascript

Copy code

`import React from 'react';
import AddSearch from './publishing/AddSearch';

const SearchPage = () => (
  <div>
    <AddSearch />
  </div>
);

export default SearchPage;` 

## Troubleshooting

-   **Authentication Issues**: Ensure your Supabase keys are correctly set up in the `.env` file.
-   **Search Issues**: Verify that the search filters and results logic are correctly implemented and interacting with the backend as expected.
-   **File Upload Issues**: Check that the Supabase storage bucket is correctly configured for uploading manuscript PDFs.
-   **Profile Management Issues**: Ensure that the profile ID is correctly passed to components handling awards, credits, and social media links.
